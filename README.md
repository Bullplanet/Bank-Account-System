🏦 Bank Account System

A simple command-line Bank Account System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
This project was developed as part of my learning journey to master core OOP concepts, including classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, and basic data handling.

📌 Features:

💳 Create a bank account

💰 Deposit money

🧾 Withdraw money with balance checks

🏦 Display current balance

👤 Account holder information (name, account number)

🚫 Prevent overdraft withdrawals

✅ Clean OOP structure using classes and methods

🛠 Technologies Used:

Python 3

Object-Oriented Programming principles

Terminal/CLI interface

🧠 What I Learned:

Creating and managing Python classes and objects

Implementing encapsulation and method-based interaction

Structuring real-world systems in code

Validating inputs and protecting data

Welcome to Python Bank!

1. Create Account
2. Deposit Funds
3. Withdraw Funds
4. Check Balance
5. Exit


📚 TODO / Future Improvements:

 Add file storage to save account data

 Allow multiple user accounts

 Add login and authentication system

 Build GUI version using tkinter or Streamlit

 Export transaction history
